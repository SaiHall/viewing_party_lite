        on from the riotous cult stage show which was born in a small studio theatre
        in the early 70s, this movie version is a well-cast, outrageous romp showcasing
        the absurdity and sci-fi obsession of Richard O''Brien''s inventive musical.\r\n\r\nThe
        small cast - the wonderful Tim Curry as Frank ''n Furter (the sweet transvestite
        from transsexual Transylvania''); Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon as the
        odd science students Brad and Janet; Patricia Quinn as Magenta (''a domestic'');
        Little Nell as Columbia (''a groupie''), Jonathan Adams as Dr Scott; Meat
        Loaf as Eddie; Richard O''Brien himself as the handyman Riff Raff; Peter Hinwood
        as the muscle man Rocky, created by Frank in a spoof on Frankenstein; and
        Charles Gray having a great time as the Criminologist - are all really good,
        and the songs are terrific, from the madness of ''The Timewarp'' and ''Sweet
        Transvestite'', to the ethereal ''There''s a Light'' and ''I''m Going Home'',
        by way of the rocky ''Whatever Happened To Saturday Night?'' and the film-reference
        heavy ''Science Fiction Double Feature''.\r\n\r\nGreat, great fun and the
        floor show sequence in particular, showcasing Frank''s obsession with Fay
        Wray and the RKO cheapies, is exceptional, with its statues in basques and
        its huge swimming pool. Trash, yes, but classy trash, and most enjoyable.","created_at":"2015-06-10T04:32:48.391Z","id":"5577bdf09251413e3e0009cb","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:35.067Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5577bdf09251413e3e0009cb"},{"author":"Peter89Spencer","author_details":{"name":"","username":"Peter89Spencer","avatar_path":"/https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dadb1b759a8516c815cdcc58abcefc85.jpg","rating":8.0},"content":"A
